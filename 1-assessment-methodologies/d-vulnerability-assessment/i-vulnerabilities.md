# i - Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerabilities

**NIST “Vulnerability” definition**

A **weakness** in the computational logic (e.g. **code**) found in software and hardware components that, **when exploited**, results in a negative impact to **confidentiality, integrity, or availability.**

**Who found vulnerabilities ?**

▪ DevSecOps engineers

▪ Security Researchers

▪ Pentesters

▪ Software Developers

▪ Users, on accident ?

**CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**

&#x20;   ▪ Reference-method for publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures.

**NVD: National Vulnerability Database**

&#x20;  ▪ U.S. government repository of vulnerability management data.

**CVE Identifiers**

▪ Also called:

→ CVE names

→ CVE numbers

→ CVE-IDs

→ CVEs
