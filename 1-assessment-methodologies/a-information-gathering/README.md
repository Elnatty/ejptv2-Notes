# A - Introduction to Information Gathering

* This is the 1st phase of step of any penetration test and involves gathering or collecting info about an individual.
* The more info you have on your target, the more successful you will be during the latter stages of a pen test.
* Info gathering is broken down into 2 types:
  * **Passive Info Gathering** - involves gathering as much info as possible without actively engaging with the target.
  * **Active Info Gathering** - involves gathering as much info as possible by actively engaging with the target system. (you will require authorization in order to perform active info gathering).

## What Information are we looking for?

### Passive Info Gathering

* identifying ip addresses & DNS information.
* identifying domain names and domain ownership information.
* Identifying email addresses and social media profiles.
* Identifying web technologies being used on target sites.
* Identifying subdomains.

### Active Info Gathering

* Discovering open ports on targets systems.
* Learning about the internal infrastructure of a target network/organization.
* Enumerating Information from target systems.
