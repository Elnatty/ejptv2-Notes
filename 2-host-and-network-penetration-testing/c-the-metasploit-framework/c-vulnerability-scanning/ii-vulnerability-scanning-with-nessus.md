# ii - Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

### **Vulnerability Scanning With Nessus**

* Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable.
* We can utilize Nessus to perform a vulnerability scan on a target system, after which, we can import the Nessus results in to MSF for analysis and exploitation.
* Nessus automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities and also provides us with information pertinent to a vulnerability like the CVE code.
* We can use the free version of Nessus (Nessus Essentials), which allows us to scan up to 16 IPs.

### **Lab Environment**

* For the purposes of demonstrating the vulnerability scanning process, we will be utilizing an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine called Metasploitable3 that is based on Windows Server 2008.
* Metasploitable3 was developed by Rapid7 to demonstrate how MSF can be used to perform exploitation of a Windows System.
* Instructions on how this VM can be setup can be found here: [https://bit.ly/3kASwns](https://bit.ly/3kASwns)



## **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
# To use Nessus, you have to create an account and get an activation code.
# After installing it:
chmod +x <packagename> # make it executable.
sudo dpkg -i <package name> # install it.
sudo systemctl start nessus.service # Start Nessus service, then check status.
# Then, go to https://kali:8834/ to configure/use the scanner.

click [newscan] tab, [basic scan]
# After doing a scan, you can see all of the vulnerabilities Nessus discovered and filter them as you want.

# To export the results and then import them to MSF, click "Export" > "Nessus". Then:
msf6 > db_import <pathToNessusReport> #Import the scan into the MSFdb ie, /home/kali/Downloads/Nessus_scan_export..

msf6 > vulns # List every vulnerabilities and their corresponding ports/services
msf6 > vulns -p <port> #List vulnerabilities for the specified port
msf6 > search cve:<year> name:<serviceName> #Search for exploit by specifying the disclosed date and service name
```
