# Dking Exploit Methodology



{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
# method 1
nmap -sV -Pn -O $ip -p-
after the nmap scan, search the service versions on google for a CVE code vuln related to that service version, using google dorks.
# for example, the "vsftpd 2.3.4" FTP vuln in Metasploitable 2.
site:cvedetails.com "vsftpd 2.3.4"  # check if there is a vuln with a CVE code.

# after that, search the CVE code on popularr sites.
site:rapid7.com | site:exploit-db.com | site:nvd.nist.gov "vstpd 2.3.4"  # you can add other sites too.
# in msfconsole, use search and search
msf5 > search cve:2011 name:vsftpd
msf5 > search name:vstpd

# method 2
# you can also search with "searchsploit"
searchsploit cve:2011 name:vsftpd 
searchsploit name:vstpd # or search the name directly.
# if this leads to a dead-end, then try method 2.

# method 3
# scan with nessus sscan then import .xml file into metasploit.
