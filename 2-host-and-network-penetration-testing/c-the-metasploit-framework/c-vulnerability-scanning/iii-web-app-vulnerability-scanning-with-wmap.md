# iii - Web App Vulnerability Scanning With WMAP

### **WMAP**

* WMAP is a powerful, feature-rich web application vulnerability scanner that can be used to automate web server enumeration and scan web applications for vulnerabilities.
* WMAP is available as an MSF plugin and can be loaded directly into MSF.
* WMAP is fully integrated with MSF, which consequently allows us to perform web app vulnerability scanning from within the MSF.



## **Practical Demonstration**

```bash
service postgresql start && msfconsole
# setup workspace.

msf5 > load wmap #Load the WMAP plugin into MSF

# 1
msf5 > wmap_sites -a $ip #Add a website to WMAP (wmap_sites -h) for help.
msf5 > wmap_sites -l #List every WMAP sites configured to be scanned.

# 2
msf5 > wmap_targets -t http://$ip>/ #Add a URL to the target list (https if using SSL certificate (port 443)

# 3
msf5 > wmap_targets -l # List every WMAP targets configured to be scanned.

# 4
msf5 > wmap_run -t # Show all enabled WMAP modules used to scan targets.

# 5
msf5 > wmap_run -e #Run the vulnerability scan.

msf5 > wmap_vulns -l #Show all vulnerabilities found by WMAP.

# mannual tests
# enumerating the supported http methods on the target site.
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/options
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put # specify an upload webpage.
