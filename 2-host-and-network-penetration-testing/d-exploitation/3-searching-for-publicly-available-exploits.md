# 3 - Searching For Publicly Available Exploits

* After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
* Exploit code can easily be found online, however, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous. It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it works as intended.
* There are handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online:
  * Exploit-db [exploit-db.com\] maintained by Offensive Security](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  * Rapid7  [https://www.rapid7.com/db/](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
  * Latest Exploits [https://packetstormsecurity.com](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)

## <mark style="color:red;">Searching For Exploits With SearchSploit</mark>

In certain cases, you may not have access to online exploits and as a result, you must be able to use the exploit sources available locally/offline.

The entire Exploit-db database of exploits comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux, consequently providing you with all exploits locally.

The Exploit-db offline database of exploits can be accessed and queried with a tool called "SearchSploit".

```bash
searchsploit -h # help menu.
searchsploit -u # update db.
searchsploit -m <moduleID> # copy an exploit to current pwd.
searchsploit -c OpenSSH # for caseSenSiTiVe searches. Results diff from "openssh".
searchsploit -t vsftpt # outputs results with Title name "vsftpd".
searchsploit -e "OpenSSH" | grep -e "ssh" # exact match searches.
searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4 | grep -i -e "metasploit"
```
