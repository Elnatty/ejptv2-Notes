# 1 - Introduction To Exploitation

### **Exploitation**

* Exploitation consists of techniques and tools used by adversaries/penetration testers to gain an initial foothold on a target system or network.
* Successful exploitation will heavily depend on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration performed on the target.
* So far, we have covered exploitation of Windows & Linux systems both manually and automatically, however, we still need to get a clearer picture of the exploitation methodology and the tools and techniques involved in the process.

### **Penetration Testing Execution Standard**

* The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is a penetration testing methodology that was developed by a team of information security practitioners with the aim of addressing the need for a comprehensive and up-to-date standard for penetration testing.

### **Exploitation Methodology**

* Identify Vulnerable Services
* Identify & Prepare Exploit Code
* Gaining Access
  * Automated - MSF
  * Manual
* Obtain remote access on target system
* Bypass AV detection
* Pivot on to other systems
