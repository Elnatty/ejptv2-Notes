# 4 - Fixing Exploits

### **Practical Demonstration**

```bash
nmap -sV $ip 

searchsploit -m <exploitID> #Copy the exploit file to your current directory
mousepad <exploitFile> #Modify the exploit file with a graphical text editor (can be done with nano or vim).

```





## <mark style="color:red;">Cross-Compiling Exploits</mark>

* In certain cases, exploit code will be developed in C/C++/C#, as a result, you will need to compile the exploit code in to a PE (Portable Executable) or binary.
* Cross-Compiling is the process of compiling code for a platform other than, the one performing the compilation.
* As a penetration tester, you will need to have the skills necessary to compile exploit code developed in C.

## Practical Demonstration

```bash
#We need to have MinGW installed
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64 #Install program itself
sudo apt-get install gcc #Install dependencies

# compiling the windows exploit.
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploitFileID> -o <PEname> #Compile the exploit in x64 version for Windows
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc <exploitFileID> -o <PEname> -lws2_32 #Compile the exploit in x32 version for Windows

gcc -pthread <exploitFileName> -o <PEname> -lcrypt #Compile the exploit in x64 version for Linux as shown in the documentation of a particular exploit
