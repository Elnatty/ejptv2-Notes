# 2 - Windows Local Enumeration

## <mark style="color:red;">Enumerating System Information</mark>

* After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what OS is running as well as the OS version. This information is very useful as it gives us an idea of what we can do and what type of exploits we can run.
* What are we looking for?
  * Host-name.
  * OS Name (Windows 7, 8, etc).
  * OS Build & Service Pack (Windows 7 SP1 7600).
  * OS Architecture (x64/x86).
  * Installed Updates/Hot-fixes.

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
meterpreter > getuid #Return username
meterpreter > sysinfo #Return system info like hostname, architecture, etc

shell > hostname #Return hostname
shell > systeminfo #Return every OS info like build number, service pack, hotfixes, etc
shell > wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn #Return in-depth info about hotfixes
shell > cat C:\\Windows/System32/eula.txt #Provide other system info (Might not be in every Windows system)
```
{% endcode %}
