# 3 - Linux Local Enumeration

## Enumerating System Information

▪ After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what OS is running as well as the OS version. This information is very useful as it gives us an idea of what we can do and what type of exploits we can run.

▪ What are we looking for?

→ Hostname

→ Distribution & distribution release version

→ Kernel version & architecture

→ Disk information & mounted drives

→ Installed packages/software

**Practical Demonstration**

```
meterpreter > getuid #Return username
meterpreter > sysinfo #Return system info like hostname, architecture, etc

shell > hostname #Return hostname
shell > cat /etc/issue #Return distribution version
shell > cat /etc/*release #Return in-depth info about the distribution
shell > uname -a #Return hostname, kernel version/architecture
shell > uname -r #Return kernel version
shell > env #Display the environment variables for the current user
shell > lscpu #Display CPU information
shell > free -h #Display RAM information
shell > df -h #List the different file systems
shell > df -ht <fileExtension> #List file systems with mentionned file extension
shell > lsblk | grep <query> #Display info about queryied storage devices/partitions
shell > dpkg -l #List installed packages on a Debian distribution
```
