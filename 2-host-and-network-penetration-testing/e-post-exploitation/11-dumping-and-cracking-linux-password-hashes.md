# 11 - Dumping & Cracking Linux Password Hashes

### **Linux Password Hashes**

* Linux has multi-user support and as a result, multiple users can access the system simultaneously. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage from a security perspective, in that, multiple accounts offer multiple access vectors for attackers and therefore increase the overall risk of the server.
* All of the information for all accounts on linux is stored in the passwd file located in: /etc/passwd
* We cannot view the passwords for the users in the passwd file because they are encrypted and the passwd file is readable by any user on the system.
* All the encrypted passwords for the users are stored in the shadow file. It can be found in the following directory: etc/shadow
* The shadow file can only be accessed and read by the root account, this is a very important security feature as it prevents other accounts on the system from accessing the hashed passwords.

### **Linux Password Hashes**

* The shadow file gives information in regards to the hashing algorithm that is being used and the password hash, this is very helpful as we are able to determine the type of hashing algorithm that is being used and it's strength. We can determine this by looking at the number after the username encapsulated by the dollar symbol ($).

| Value | Hashing Algorithm |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| $1    | MD5               |
| $2    | Blowfish          |
| $5    | SHA-256           |
| $6    | SHA-512           |

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
msf5 > use post/linux/gather/hashdump # Dump the password hashes for all users on a Linux system. This module provides the unshadowed hash.

john --format=<hashFormat> <hashFile> --wordlist=<wordlist> #Crack a hash with JohnTheRipper (default JTH wordlist if wordlist flag isn't specified)

hashcat -a<attackMode> -m <hashMode> <hashFile> <wordlist>
```
{% endcode %}
