# A - System Host Based Attacks

## **What are System/Host Based Attacks ?**

* System/Host based attacks are attacks that are targeted towards a specific system or host running a specific operating system, for example, Windows or Linux.
* Network services are not the only attack vector that can be targeted during a penetration test.
* System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained access to a target network, whereby, you will be required to exploit servers, workstations or laptops on the internal network.

### **System/Host Based Attacks**

* System/Host based attacks are primarily focused on exploiting inherent vulnerabilities on the target OS.
* Unlike network based attacks, host based attacks are much more specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system and the vulnerabilities that affect said operating systems.
* System/Host based attacks involve exploiting mis-configurations and inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS.
* In this course, we will primarily be focusing on Windows and Linux vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.
