# a - Linux Vulnerabilities

### **Frequently Exploited Linux Services**

* Linux is a free and open source operating system that is comprised of the Linux kernel, which was developed by Linux Torvalds, and the GNU toolkit, which is a collection of software and utilities that was started and developed by Richard Stallman.
* This combination of open source software is what makes up the Linux OS as a whole, and it is commonly referred to as GNU/Linux.
* Linux has various use cases, however, it is typically deployed as a server operating system. For this reason, there are specific services and protocols that will typically be found running on a Linux server.
* These services provide an attacker with an access vector that they can utilize to gain access to a target host.
* Having a good understanding of what these services are, how they work and their potential vulnerabilities is a vitally important skill to have as a penetration tester.
