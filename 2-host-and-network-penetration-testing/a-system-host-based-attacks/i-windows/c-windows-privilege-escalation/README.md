### **Privilege Escalation**

* Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system.
* Privilege escalation is a vital element of the attack life cycle and is a major determinant in the overall success of a penetration test.
* After gaining an initial foothold on a target system you will be required to elevate your privileges in order to perform tasks and functionality that require administrative privileges.
* The importance of privilege escalation in the penetration testing process cannot be overstated or overlooked. Developing your privilege escalation skills will park you out as a good penetration tester.
