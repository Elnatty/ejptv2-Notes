# a - Overview of Windows Vulnerabilities

## **A Brief History of Windows Vulnerabilities**

* Microsoft Windows is the dominant operating system worldwide with a market share >= 70% as of 2021.
* The popularity and deployment of Windows by individuals and companies makes it a prime target for attackers given the threat surface.
* Over the last 15 years, Windows has had its fair share of severe vulnerabilities, ranging from MS08-067 (Conflicker) to MS17-010 (EternalBlue).
* Given the popularity of Windows, most of these vulnerabilities have publicly accessible exploit code making them relatively straightforward to exploit.

## **Windows Vulnerabilities**

* Microsoft Windows has various OS versions and releases which makes the threat surface fragmented in terms of vulnerabilities. For example, vulnerabilities that exist in Windows 7 are not present in Windows 10.
* Regardless of the various versions and releases, all Windows OS's share a likeness given the development model and philosophy:
* Windows OS's have been developed in the C programming language, making them vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, etc.
* By default, Windows is not configured to run securely and require a proactive implementation o security practices in order to configure Windows to run securely.
* Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not immediately patched by Microsoft and given the fragmentation nature of Windows, many systems are left unpatched.
* The frequent releases of new versions of Windows is also a contributing factor to exploitation, as many companies take a substantial length of time to upgrade their systems to the latest version of Windows and opt to use older versions that may be affected by an increasing number of vulnerabilities.
* In additions to inherent vulnerabilities, Windows is also vulnerable to cross platform vulnerabilities, for example SQL injection attacks.
* System/hosts running Windows are also vulnerable to physical attacks like: theft, malicious peripheral devices etc.
